## Function of the Project
1. There are three roles as admin, store manager, and user.
2. Anyone can view products as a guest (without login).
3. Only users who logged in to the system can place orders.
4. Once the admin creates a login for the store manager, it should be notified to the
store manager via email.
5. Admin can create categories for the products.
6. The store manager can,
Add products with details to the relevant category
Add discounts to selected products.
7. User can add products to the shopping cart.
8. Users can purchase the selected products in the shopping cart by selecting the
payment method (card/cash on delivery, etc.).
9. Users can create a wish list from their preferred products and later they can add
those products to the shopping cart.
10. Users can rate the products and add comments and average ratings, comments
should be displayed for products.
11. The system should be secured and cannot be accessed without a proper
authentication.
12. Authorization should be maintained, and users cannot order products without
going through payment methods. (No need of integrating to a payment gateway,
but until the step of payment the system should be implemented).
